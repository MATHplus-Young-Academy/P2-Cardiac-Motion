# Cardiac motion estimation using heart models
Utilise (dynamic) heart models to estimate the anatomical changes of the heart during the cardiac cycle. An approach would be developed to accurately estimate cardiac motion from 3D cardiac MR acquisitions. The final aim is to integrate the estimated cardiac motion in the MR image reconstruction algorithm to correct for it.
